# GitHub Account Finder

## Assignment by Utkarsh Mishra - #FunctionupAssignment

### Project Description

The GitHub Account Finder project is linked to the GitHub RestAPI, providing essential information for the success of the application. It retrieves names and links to any GitHub repository that you query. To get started, follow the instructions below.

### Used Technologies

- React.js
- HTML
- CSS
- Postman API

### How to Initiate?

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/github-account-finder.git
   ```

2. Change into the project directory.
   ```bash
   cd github-account-finder
   ```

3. Install dependencies using npm.
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the application in development mode.
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the app.

6. The page will automatically reload when you make changes, and any lint errors will be displayed in the console.

### Running Tests

To run tests, use the following command:
```bash
npm test
```
This launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. Refer to the test section for more information.

### Building for Production

To build the app for production, use:
```bash
npm run build
```

This command bundles React in production mode, optimizes the build for performance, and generates a build folder. The build is minified, and filenames include hashes.

Your app is now ready to be deployed.

Refer to the deployment section for more information.

### Ejecting

Note: Ejecting is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back.

If you're dissatisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This removes the single build dependency from your project and copies all configuration files and transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project, giving you full control.

All commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts. You're now on your own.

Remember, ejecting is optional. The curated feature set is suitable for small to middle deployments, and you're not obligated to use this feature. However, the option is available when you're ready for customization.
